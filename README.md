DataTrac Add-In for Excel

This add-in allows users to interact with Daktronics DataTrac text-based displays using data from the open workbook. Users can create messages that refresh either manually or automatically on interval. Messages can contain Excel functions which are evaluated before sending to the display, allowing users to display some of the contents of the workbook on the sign.
When a message is sent, the application sends the command over the COM port specified during display creation.
